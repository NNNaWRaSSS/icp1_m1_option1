# Module I Assignment

## Program Content
This project is designed to help you understand and implement key programming concepts. The main focus will be on developing functions that perform specific tasks and ensuring that these functions work correctly through testing.

## Requirements
1. **Implement Functions**: You need to create several functions that are specified in /src/myprogram.c
2. **Testing**: Tests for each function to verify their correctness are already written in /tests/tests.cpp. This project has googletest configured and enabled to run the tests.
